# 🫁 Lung Cancer Data Analysis Project

## 📊 Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a large-scale dataset of lung cancer patients to uncover trends, risk factors, and survival patterns using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

The analysis focuses on how age, gender, smoking habits, and cancer stage impact the survival of patients.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: [Lung Cancer Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khwaishsaxena/lung-cancer-dataset)
- **Records**: ~890,000
- **Features**: 17 (age, gender, country, cancer stage, diagnosis dates, treatment, and survival)

*Note: The full dataset is too large to upload (>25MB). For demo or visualization, a sample or cleaned subset can be used.*

## 📊 Key Analyses & Visualizations

- Survival Rate Distribution
- Impact of Gender and Smoking on Survival
- Cancer Stage vs Survival Rate
- Age Distribution Analysis
- Correlation Heatmap of Medical Conditions

## 🔍 Key Insights

- 🚬 **Smokers had significantly lower survival rates**.
- 🧓 **Older age** (especially above 60) reduces survival probability.
- 🎯 **Cancer stage** strongly affects outcome—Stage III & IV have lower survival.
- 👩 Female patients show slightly better survival than male.
